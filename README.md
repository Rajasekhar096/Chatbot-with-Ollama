## Basic Olllama Open Source Chatbot application

This project is a Q&A Chatbot built with Streamlit and LangChain, leveraging the power of Ollama for generating intelligent and meaningful responses to user questions. 
It's a user-friendly app that allows users to ask questions and receive answers from an open-source language model.

#### Features
Interactive Chatbot: Type a question and get an AI-generated response in real time.

Dynamic Model Selection: Choose your desired model from the sidebar.

Customizable Responses: Adjust the temperature parameter for controlling the creativity of the responses.

Open Source Powered: Uses the Ollama LLM for generating answers.

LangSmith Integration: Tracks and logs interactions for better model performance insights.


#### How It Works
Prompt Template: The chatbot uses a predefined prompt template to set the system's behavior and handle user questions.

Model Initialization: The app initializes the Ollama LLM only once for efficiency.

Dynamic Responses: The response is generated by combining LangChain's processing and the chosen model's output.

Streamlit Interface: A simple, web-based UI built with Streamlit for user interaction.
